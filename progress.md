# Gym progress 

## Here's what works for me

- Start
  - Put the phone away
  - Do something
  - Stay consistent
- Learn about working out
  - Listen to YouTube during commutes
  - Read library books at night and on the weekends
- Push/Pull/Legs split
  - Skip the cardio
  - Train muscle groups 2x per week
  - Active rest day
- Focus on form
  - Less weight
  - Take it slow
  - No momentum
- Progressive overload
  - Sets and reps
  - Increase the weight
  - Setup next exercise, decrease rest time
- Don't count reps; make the reps count
  - Quality reps
  - Rest pause, continue
- Train hard; not long
  - Stopwatch: time the session and rest times
  - Treat each set like your last
- Eat and drink more
  - Calculate goal macronutrients (calories, protein, fats, carbs)
  - Track and measure your regular meals for a few days or a week
  - Eat enough of the right foods to meet your goal
  - Double water intake
