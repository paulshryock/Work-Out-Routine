# Gym progress 

## Here's what works for me

- Start
  - Put the phone away, airplane mode, etc.
  - Do something, anything
  - Set some goals and objectives
- Stay consistent
  - Plan tomorrow's workout today
  - Set yourself up for success the day before
    - Getting home, empty and refill gym bag, put it back in the car
    - Set recurring calendar events as reminders, so meetings aren't scheduled
- While consistently doing 'something', learn about working out
  - Learn from experts (personal trainers, strength coaches, physical therapists, dieticians, pro bodybuilders)
  - Subscribe and listen to YouTube/podcasts during daily commutes
  - Read library books at night and on the weekends
- Build a real routine
  - Skip the cardio
  - Add new exercises intentionally
  - Keep daily workouts log
  - Train each muscle group 2x per week (Push/Pull/Legs/Push/Pull/Legs/Rest)
  - Active rest day: abs, cardio, yardwork, move heavy furniture, etc.
- Avoid unnecessary injury, recover well
  - Warm-up before every workout
  - Stretch after every workout
  - Buy a foam roller, use for a couple minutes 2-3x a day
  - Sleep consistently every night
- Focus on form
  - Less weight
  - Take it slow
  - No momentum
- Progressive overload
  - Diverse sets and rep ranges
  - Increase the weight
  - Setup next exercise while resting
- Don't count reps; make the reps count
  - Quality reps
  - Mind-muscle connection
  - End of each set, rest pause, continue an extra rep or two
- Train hard; not long
  - Stopwatch: time the session and rest times
  - Treat each set like your last
- Eat and drink more
  - Calculate goal macronutrients (calories, protein, fats, carbs)
  - Track and measure your regular meals for a few days or a week
  - Eat enough of the right foods throughout the whole day to meet your goal
  - Double water intake

## Here's what helps

- Verbal encouragement from others (in and out of the gym)
- Tracking everything (workouts, nutrition, weight)
